# ThermoriaVerse
[Polski](./README_PL.md)

**A work-in-progress sandbox game focused on exploration, progression, and achievements, built in C#.**

## Official Description of the game
As the Architect, journey across a planet crafted from voxels—full of vibrant landscapes, life, and hidden powerful forces.
Shape the worlds according to your own imagination: raising mountains, lowering lands, or creating massive structures. Every voxel, every plant, and every creature reacts to your presence.
Build and destroy in the spirit of classic sandbox games, combined with the modern 3D approach of voxel pixel art.
Discover unique biomes, ancient ruins, hidden sanctuaries, and cities teeming with life.
Travel the world on foot or observe it from above—as the omniscient Architect.
Control individual NPCs or observe from above. Help them survive, thrive, fight, or build civilizations, or leave them as they are and watch your world.
Every decision has consequences—you can become their savior or their destroyer. Procedural world generation, biomes and vegetation, a dynamic chunk system, and GPU optimization ensure the game runs smoothly even in vast, complex environments with extensive render ranges.
**ThermoriaVerse** — create your own multiverse.
